# Efrem Daniel : Data_engineer:

I’m a computer science student at STI, currently focusing on data engineering and data-driven development. During my studies and personal projects, I’ve gained hands-on experience with tools like Python, SQL, DuckDB, Taipy, Docker, Git, and GitHub. I enjoy working with data – from collecting and transforming it, to building simple pipelines and exploring how data can support decision-making.

I’m now looking for an internship where I can apply what I’ve learned in a real-world environment. I'm eager to join a team where I can contribute to meaningful projects, learn from experienced developers, and improve my practical skills within data engineering. I’m curious, responsible, and motivated to grow in this field – and I look forward to the opportunity to learn by doing.
